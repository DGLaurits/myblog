        Hi! I'm Laurits Madsen,<br><br>
        I'm a math and tech enthusiast, and I enjoy doing various small projects, so I created this website in order to
        share them with the random people, who end up here on their journey throughout the web.<br>
        I am currently a student at The Technical University of Denmark (DTU), studying a bachelor in engineering called
        "Mathematics and Technology". This summarizes well what I upload on this site. If you wish to contact me, I prefer
        getting messaged over LinkedIn. And if you're interested in seeing what I'm currently working on, and my precious
        projects, you can click on "Projects" in
        the upper navigation menu.<br><br>
        Have a nice day :)

    </p>
